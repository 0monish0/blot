- Slide the other aluminum rail between the wheels on the bottom of the carriage (so that the idler part is facing upwards).
- Screw the belt tensioner onto the end of the aluminum rail using 10mm M5 screws and t-nuts (again, facing upwards - the top protrusion on the part with a ribbed surface for the belt to mesh with should align horizontally with the idler).

- Thread belt through machine according to diagram below, starting at the belt tensioner. You can use a small allen key to pull the belt through. Make sure the teeth of the belt are facing towards the matching teeth on the belt tensioner part so they can mesh together. It might help to tape the end of the belt to the belt tensioner temporarily so it doesn't come unthreaded.

- Pull the belt taut at the ends and hold the two belt clamp caps in place. Insert the two M5 30mm screws on one side and install/tighten hex nuts on the other side.

- Adjust the height of the belt pulleys so the belt is level with the idlers. You can do this easily by sliding the carriage all the way to one side, adjusting the height of the pulley, then tightening the two set screws. Repeat this for the other pulley.
