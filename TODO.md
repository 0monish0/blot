# TODO

## Hardware

### Mechanical

- pen holder design

### Electrical

The [circuits used in the system are designed here](https://github.com/modular-things/modular-things-circuits). 
I would love to see people remake the circuit designs in [SVG-PCB](https://leomcelroy.com/svg-pcb-website/#/home).

Board-to-board connection layer.

Currently our system uses point-to-point connections. 
It would be more efficient to design a bus for modular things. 
Some thoughts on [bus design for modular things are available here](https://github.com/modular-things/modular-bus).

## Software

### Editor

- add console to editor
- create interface to drawing machine in modular things

### Firmware

- sequential motor control

Cleaning up OSAP the networking library.
Jake and I are working on making OSAP more comprhensible. 
I made a [toy implementaion recreating some of OSAP's functionality](https://github.com/leomcelroy/nosap).
Making a visualizer for OSAP networks would be a great project.

## Engagement (Interaction Mode/Handles)

### Make a parametric generator

You can also get started working on generative design and pen plotting. 
[Drawingbots](https://drawingbots.net/) is a good resources. 
Specifically the [tool section](https://drawingbots.net/knowledge/tools) has a bunch of programs 
for making plottable patterns.
