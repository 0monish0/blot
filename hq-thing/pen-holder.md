# pen holder

##### Version 0

It took up a lot of horizontal space on the axis which reduced the range of movement on the y-axis. (We halved the length of each axis from the original design.)

The screw didn't hold the pen in place very well. I think this could be fixed by making the pen holder hole more of a fat raindrop shape rather than a circle, or increasing the surface area where the pen touches the pen holder.

The part used several different sizes of screws. M5 to secure the thing to the aluminum extrusion. M2.5 for the hinge part. M2 or 2.5 for the servo. M3 for holding the pen in place.

Are any of these screw sizes required for other parts of the machine?
M5 for idlers, t-nuts, etc. M3 for steppers. The Sprig uses M2, so maybe we could get rid of the M2.5 and use M2 screws for the servo?

I think the rubber band was a good idea because it seemed to work well and was low-cost.

The main issue this one solves is being more vertical instead of horizontal.

This one didn't look very good. The pen was too far from the surface which made it more unstable. The rubber band part could be improved.

##### plastic thing

Use flexibility of plastic for pen pressure. Secured by 2 zip ties which seemed to improve stability.

Needs to be able to move up and down.

##### using pen springs

The pen hole is raindrop shaped and is taller than the previous designs. I think it holds the pen well.

I wonder if the nail could be replaced with something else. Maybe plastic?
