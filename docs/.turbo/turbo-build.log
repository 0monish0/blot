(node:50135) [MODULE_NOT_FOUND] Error: @types/node tried to access events. While this module is usually interpreted as a Node builtin, your resolver is running inside a non-Node resolution context where such builtins are ignored. Since events isn't otherwise declared in @types/node's dependencies, this makes the require call ambiguous and unsound.
