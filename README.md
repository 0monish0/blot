# The Haxidraw

Hack Club is working on our next "you ship, we ship" project. This time if you make some digital art we'll send you a robot which can make that art real!

We're also working with some researchers at MIT to make digital fabrication machines like this much more open and hackable. We're doing this by taking functionality which would ordinarily be inaccessible in the firmware and lifting it up to the user in a programmable browser editor. We call it [Modular Things](https://github.com/modular-things/modular-things).

# Getting Involved

We have a [TODO](./TODO.md) list which you can check out for various tasks that are being worked on (or need to be worked on). 

One of the best ways to get involved is by building and testing one of the machines. All you need is a 3D printer and a little bit of hardware outlined in the [bill of materials here](./drawing-thing-v1/BOM.md).

If you're a teen who wants to follow along with the project you can join the Hack Club Slack and head to the [#development-of-things-and-stuff](https://app.slack.com/client/T0266FRGM/C04GCH8A91D/thread/C04GCH8A91D-1672275851.810779) channel.
