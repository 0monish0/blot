- Put M5 hex nuts in all of the nut holes in the carriage.
- Assemble idlers by stacking 2 flanged bearings together.
  - The flanged parts should be the top and bottom.
  - Screw them to the bottom of the carriage using a ???M5 screw and 1mm shim between the carriage and the idler.
  - The idlers should be able to spin smoothly.
- Attach the v-wheels to the carriage.
  - Use a 35mm M5 screw a v-wheel and 6mm spacer between the v-wheel and the carriage.
  - Repeat for all 8 wheels.
  - If the screw appears to barely touch the nut, you can "pull" the nut deeper into the nut trap by threading a screw through the nut.

## Motors and Feet

Tools:

- M3 allen
- M5 allen
- The allen key the stepper motor pulley comes with

Parts you'll need:

- Attach ONE of the motor brackets to the aluminum extrusion using 10mm M5 screws and t-nuts in the respective holes.
- Slide the carriage onto the aluminum.
  - The distance between the wheels on each side may need to be adjusted for a better fit on the extrusion.
- Attach other motor bracket to the aluminum extrusion using 10mm M5 screws and t-nuts in respective holes.
- Attach the feet to the motor brackets using 12mm M5 screws and hex nuts inserted into the appropriate slots in them motor bracket.
- Attach pulley wheel things to the stepper motors; don't tighten all the way as you'll need to adjust the height later.
- Attach the stepper motors to the motor brackets using 10mm M3 screws.

- instructions Instructions

- Assemble idler from 2 flanged bearings and use a 20mm M5 screw to secure idler.
  - Put a shim between the plastic and the idler, and insert a hex nut into the rectangular nut trap.
- Attach servo to pen holder rail part using 2 of the 10mm M2 screws and nuts.
- Attach the pen holder rail to the idler part.
  - With the end of the idler pointing towards you, the servo should be on the right when the idler part is screwed onto the idler part.
  - Use a 20mm M5 screw in the top screw hole and a 25mm M5 screw in the bottom screw hole.
    - Be sure to insert an M5 hex nut into the respective nut traps.
