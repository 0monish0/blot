# Notes on 3D printing the parts

_I've tried to print the parts for this machine with various printers/filaments/beds/settings, and have listed my takeaways below. This was just my experience, so perhaps yours could be different._

- I recommend printing with PLA. Print at 90% speed for the first layer, with flow set to 105%. Then switch back to default (100 speed, 95 flow) after first layer.
  - 20% infill has been recommended but the default is probably fine.
  - If you print with PETG, it could still work, but print at slower speeds.
- .2mm is a good layer height to have sufficient screw hole/nut trap tolerances.
- Add circular feet to corners to avoid the corners peeling up and then messing up the fit of the part.

- Don't use the textured beds!!!!!!!!
- If you're in a time crunch, best bet is to print in 2 different batches.
- Clean bed with isopropyl alcohol for better adhesion.
